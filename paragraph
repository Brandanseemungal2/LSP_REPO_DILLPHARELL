The sky was a patchwork of clouds, each one drifting lazily through the late afternoon, casting fleeting shadows on the golden fields below. A light breeze carried the scent of pine and freshly cut grass, while the distant hum of a tractor broke the quiet stillness of the countryside. In the distance, a hawk circled gracefully, its wings spread wide as it scanned the ground for its next meal. Somewhere nearby, a dog barked, its voice echoing briefly before fading into the horizon. Everything felt timeless, as if the world had paused just for a moment to appreciate the simple beauty of the day.
